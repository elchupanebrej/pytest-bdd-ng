Responsibility:
    Defines immutable value objects that represent lifecycle state within the Run hierarchy: ActiveObjectSet (captures
    which run/feature/scenario/step objects are active at a given stage), ReportingLifecycleState (tracks cucumber-
    messages reporting IDs and timestamps), ReferenceResolverState (accumulates missing reference diagnostics), and
    ContextErrorState (records lifecycle errors with code, message, hook_name, stage, and requested_kind). All types are
    attrs-defined with slots=True and include JSON serialization via as_dict().

Reason for existence:
    This code is the authoritative information expert for its domain boundary within the pytest-bdd model layer. It is
    kept here rather than merged elsewhere because it owns specific data structures, state transitions, validation
    rules, and lookup semantics that are only coherent when collocated. Analyzing imports and control flow confirms this
    module is the single source of truth for its owned concepts

Delegates:
    - LifecycleObjectRef: Provides supporting functionality through a well-defined interface, delegating a focused sub-
    task to keep this entity cohesive and its responsibility boundary clean

Cohesion:
    All functions, methods, and data within this entity operate on the same local state, share identical import
    dependencies and control flow patterns, and collectively implement a single cohesive responsibility rather than
    dispersing unrelated utilities across separate modules

Separation:
    - _snapshots: This entity is kept distinct from its peer to prevent callers from coupling to multiple domain
    boundaries at once, ensuring each concept can evolve independently without cascading changes across the codebase

Main consumers:
    - scenario_run: Referenced by collection, runtime, and reporting layer plugins through the pytest_bdd.model public
    API, defining a stable contract that downstream layers depend on for scenario execution state, message handling, and
    stash access

State and side effects:
    Maintains in-memory state via attrs-defined fields with factory defaults, performing no file I/O, network
    operations, or direct pytest stash access; stash interaction is delegated to StashAccess class methods for type-safe
    boundary enforcement

Invariants:
    - ActiveObjectSet must capture all five lifecycle kinds (run, feature, scenario, step, previous_step);
    ReportingLifecycleState must preserve runtime_step_to_pickle_step_id mapping across scenario boundaries;
    ContextErrorState code must be one of the four defined Literal values
