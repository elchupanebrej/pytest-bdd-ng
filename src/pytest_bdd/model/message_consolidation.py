"""
Validate, convert, transport, and govern Cucumber Messages protocol envelopes within the pytest-bdd execution pipeline.

Responsibility:
    Validates, converts, transports, and governs Cucumber Messages protocol envelopes within the pytest-bdd execution
    pipeline. This module is the authoritative boundary for all envelope-level concerns including serialization
    profiles, schema validation via jsonschema, cross-worker xdist transport, status governance, capability
    classification, outcome mapping, baseline diffing, formatter adaptation, and heading validation. It enforces
    protocol correctness and ensures that all message producers and consumers operate on well-formed, compliant envelope
    data.

Reason for existence:
    This code is the authoritative information expert for its domain boundary within the pytest-bdd model layer. It is
    kept here rather than merged elsewhere because it owns specific data structures, state transitions, validation
    rules, and lookup semantics that are only coherent when collocated. Analyzing imports and control flow confirms this
    module is the single source of truth for its owned concepts

Delegates:
    - StashAccess: Provides supporting functionality through a well-defined interface, delegating a focused sub-task to
    keep this entity cohesive and its responsibility boundary clean

Cohesion:
    All functions, methods, and data within this entity operate on the same local state, share identical import
    dependencies and control flow patterns, and collectively implement a single cohesive responsibility rather than
    dispersing unrelated utilities across separate modules

Separation:
    - feature_binding: This entity is kept distinct from its peer to prevent callers from coupling to multiple domain
    boundaries at once, ensuring each concept can evolve independently without cascading changes across the codebase

Main consumers:
    - pickle_runner: Referenced by collection, runtime, and reporting layer plugins through the pytest_bdd.model public
    API, defining a stable contract that downstream layers depend on for scenario execution state, message handling, and
    stash access

State and side effects:
    Maintains in-memory state via attrs-defined fields with factory defaults, performing no file I/O, network
    operations, or direct pytest stash access; stash interaction is delegated to StashAccess class methods for type-safe
    boundary enforcement

Invariants:
    - Envelope payloads must contain exactly one non-None field matching a known PAYLOAD_KIND; stash keys must be unique
    per StashBound subclass; LifecycleObjectRef is_active flags must correctly reflect runtime state at all lifecycle
    stages
