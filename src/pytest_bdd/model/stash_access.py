Provides type-safe read/write access to pytest's config.stash dictionary for model-layer objects.

Responsibility:
    Provides type-safe read/write access to pytest's config.stash dictionary for model-layer objects. This module is the
    sole stash abstraction layer, offering optional get, required retrieval with typed errors, creation-once semantics,
    and a StashBound base class that all stash-resident entities inherit. It eliminates raw stash key manipulation and
    enforces consistent error handling for missing, type-mismatched, and duplicate stash entries across all plugin
    layers.

Reason for existence:
    This code is the authoritative information expert for its domain boundary within the pytest-bdd model layer. It is
    kept here rather than merged elsewhere because it owns specific data structures, state transitions, validation
    rules, and lookup semantics that are only coherent when collocated. Analyzing imports and control flow confirms this
    module is the single source of truth for its owned concepts

Delegates:
    - pytest_bdd.types.exception: Provides supporting functionality through a well-defined interface, delegating a
    focused sub-task to keep this entity cohesive and its responsibility boundary clean

Cohesion:
    All functions, methods, and data within this entity operate on the same local state, share identical import
    dependencies and control flow patterns, and collectively implement a single cohesive responsibility rather than
    dispersing unrelated utilities across separate modules

Separation:
    - run_access: This entity is kept distinct from its peer to prevent callers from coupling to multiple domain
    boundaries at once, ensuring each concept can evolve independently without cascading changes across the codebase

Main consumers:
    - pickle_runner: Referenced by collection, runtime, and reporting layer plugins through the pytest_bdd.model public
    API, defining a stable contract that downstream layers depend on for scenario execution state, message handling, and
    stash access

State and side effects:
    Maintains in-memory state via attrs-defined fields with factory defaults, performing no file I/O, network
    operations, or direct pytest stash access; stash interaction is delegated to StashAccess class methods for type-safe
    boundary enforcement

Invariants:
    - STASH_KEY must be unique per StashBound subclass; stash values must pass isinstance check against their declared
    type; stash double-initialization must raise PytestBDDStashAlreadyInitializedError

Failure semantics:
    Raises RuntimeError for context-not-initialized or binding-missing conditions when required lifecycle objects are
    unavailable; raises TypeError for malformed envelopes violating single-payload or type constraints; raises
    ValueError for missing required fields in deserialized transport payloads; callers must handle these exceptions at
    hook or plugin boundaries to prevent test session crashes
