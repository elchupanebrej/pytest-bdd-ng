"""
Owns the scenario execution lifecycle state machine including RunNode tracking, StepRun data, and ScenarioRun context.

Responsibility:
    Owns the scenario execution lifecycle state machine including RunNode tracking, StepRun data, and ScenarioRun
    context management. This module defines the canonical runtime objects that drive BDD scenario execution: managing
    lifecycle transitions, recording context errors, ensuring required objects (gherkin document, pickle, step object,
    feature binding) are available before use, and orchestrating cleanup at scenario completion. It is the single source
    of truth for what scenario execution state looks like at any point in the test lifecycle.

Reason for existence:
    This code is the authoritative information expert for its domain boundary within the pytest-bdd model layer. It is
    kept here rather than merged elsewhere because it owns specific data structures, state transitions, validation
    rules, and lookup semantics that are only coherent when collocated. Analyzing imports and control flow confirms this
    module is the single source of truth for its owned concepts

Delegates:
    - run refs module: Provides supporting functionality through a well-defined interface, delegating a focused sub-task
    to keep this entity cohesive and its responsibility boundary clean

Cohesion:
    All functions, methods, and data within this entity operate on the same local state, share identical import
    dependencies and control flow patterns, and collectively implement a single cohesive responsibility rather than
    dispersing unrelated utilities across separate modules

Separation:
    - run_access: This entity is kept distinct from its peer to prevent callers from coupling to multiple domain
    boundaries at once, ensuring each concept can evolve independently without cascading changes across the codebase

Main consumers:
    - pickle_runner: Referenced by collection, runtime, and reporting layer plugins through the pytest_bdd.model public
    API, defining a stable contract that downstream layers depend on for scenario execution state, message handling, and
    stash access

State and side effects:
    Maintains in-memory state via attrs-defined fields with factory defaults, performing no file I/O, network
    operations, or direct pytest stash access; stash interaction is delegated to StashAccess class methods for type-safe
    boundary enforcement

Invariants:
    - ScenarioRun must always have a valid parent Run reference; transition_index must be monotonic; active_hook must
    reflect the currently executing hook phase; require_* methods must raise RuntimeError with recorded context errors
    when required objects are unavailable

Failure semantics:
    Raises RuntimeError for context-not-initialized or binding-missing conditions when required lifecycle objects are
    unavailable; raises TypeError for malformed envelopes violating single-payload or type constraints; raises
    ValueError for missing required fields in deserialized transport payloads; callers must handle these exceptions at
    hook or plugin boundaries to prevent test session crashes

        Failure semantics:
            Raises RuntimeError for context-not-initialized or binding-missing conditions when required lifecycle
            objects are unavailable; raises TypeError for malformed envelopes violating single-payload or type
            constraints; raises ValueError for missing required fields in deserialized transport payloads; callers must
            handle these exceptions at hook or plugin boundaries to prevent test session crashes
