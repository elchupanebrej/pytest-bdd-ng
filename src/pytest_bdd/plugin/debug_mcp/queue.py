"""
Implement plugin module operations for pytest-bdd.

Responsibility:
    Provides focused operations for this pytest-bdd plugin module, implementing a single well-defined capability
    consumed by the broader BDD infrastructure.

Reason for existence:
    Consolidates related logic within a single module boundary to maintain high cohesion and serve as the information
    expert for its domain concepts.

Delegates:
    - Collaborating modules and standard library: provide supporting infrastructure through well-defined interfaces.

Cohesion:
    All logic within this entity operates on a single responsibility domain with focused imports and control flow.

Separation:
    - Peer entities in sibling modules: kept separate to prevent callers from coupling to unrelated knowledge domains.

Main consumers:
    - pytest_bdd.*: higher layers and sibling modules that consume this entity through its public API contract.

State and side effects:
    None, keeps no persistent state beyond local scope.

Invariants:
    - All public API contracts defined by this entity must be honored by callers.

            consumed by the broader BDD infrastructure.

        Reason for existence:
            Consolidates related logic within a single module boundary to maintain high cohesion and serve as the
            information expert for its domain concepts.

        Delegates:
            - Collaborating modules and standard library: provide supporting infrastructure through well-defined interfaces.

        Cohesion:
            All logic within this entity operates on a single responsibility domain with focused imports and control flow.

        Separation:
            - Peer entities in sibling modules: kept separate to prevent callers from coupling to unrelated knowledge domains.

        Main consumers:
            - pytest_bdd.*: higher layers and sibling modules that consume this entity through its public API contract.

        State and side effects:
            None, keeps no persistent state beyond local scope.
